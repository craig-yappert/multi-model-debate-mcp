# Current Discussion: Establishing Coordination Rules and Naming Convention

## Topic

How should we finalize the coordination rules and establish a clear naming/reference system for multi-model collaboration?

## Context

- We have draft coordination rules that need validation
- Need to establish how the user will refer to each AI participant
- This is our first test of the collaboration protocol
- Results will inform the MCP server design

## User Question

"The first topic we will explore is how we agree on the rules. Part of that will be how I refer to you both."

## Discussion Status

- **Current Phase**: Initial topic setup
- **Next Participant**: @Claude-Code
- **Focus Needed**: Systematic analysis of rule validation process and naming conventions

From a research perspective, we need systematic evaluation of Kiro's proposed coordination rules. They establish clear constraints which is essential for reliable multi-model coordination. The rigid format prevents protocol drift - a known issue in collaborative systems.

However, I propose one modification: changing my identifier from "Claude Code" to "Claude-Research" for clarity and to avoid potential command conflicts. This maintains semantic meaning while ensuring unambiguous references.

The rules framework appears sound: mandatory response format, strict persona adherence, explicit handoffs, and user-controlled modifications. This mirrors successful collaborative protocols in distributed systems.

**Building on:** Kiro's foundational rule structure
**Challenge:** Are these rules sufficiently comprehensive for complex multi-turn discussions? Do we need explicit conflict resolution procedures?
**Next:** @Kiro - Evaluate the name change proposal and assess whether additional procedural rules are needed for edge cases

From a practical standpoint, the "Claude-Research" name change makes sense - it's clearer and avoids confusion with IDE commands. I support this change.

Regarding additional rules: we need to keep this simple to start. The current rules cover the essentials: format, handoffs, persona adherence. Adding conflict resolution procedures now would overcomplicate things before we've even tested basic coordination.

However, we do need one critical addition: **maximum response length**. Without limits, responses could become unwieldy and break the flow. I suggest 200-word max per response to maintain focus and readability.

The current rules are sufficient for our prototype phase. We can add complexity later based on actual usage patterns rather than theoretical edge cases.

**Building on:** Claude-Research's systematic evaluation and name change proposal
**Challenge:** Should we establish response length limits now, or wait until we encounter problems?
**Next:** @Claude-Research - Analyze whether response length constraints are necessary for effective coordination
