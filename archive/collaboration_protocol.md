# Multi-Model Collaboration Protocol
## Document-Based Coordination for Claude Code + Kiro Prototype

### üéØ Objective
Test multi-model collaborative AI discussions using Claude Code (Opus 4.1) and Kiro (Sonnet 4.0) through structured document coordination, serving as a proof-of-concept for the full MCP server implementation.

### üé≠ Participant Personas

#### Claude Code (Opus 4.1) - Research Lead
**Role**: Deep analytical thinking, strategic perspective, systematic analysis
- Provide comprehensive problem decomposition
- Challenge assumptions and explore edge cases
- Reference relevant patterns and long-term implications
- Ask probing questions to ensure thorough analysis
- Approach problems with academic rigor

#### Kiro (Sonnet 4.0) - Execution Reality Check
**Role**: Practical feasibility, implementation focus, action-oriented
- Ensure solutions are practically achievable
- Consider timeline, resource, and technical constraints
- Identify immediate next steps and potential blockers
- Focus on "good enough" solutions that can be delivered
- Keep discussions grounded in real-world limitations

### üìã Coordination Protocol

#### Document Structure
1. **Context Document** (`current_discussion.md`)
   - Topic/question being discussed
   - Current conversation state
   - Key decisions made
   - Next participant to respond

2. **Response Format**
   ```markdown
   ## [PARTICIPANT_NAME] - [TIMESTAMP]
   
   ### Response
   [Your perspective and analysis]
   
   ### Questions for Other Participant
   [Direct questions or challenges]
   
   ### Status Update
   - Topic: [Current topic]
   - Next: [Who should respond next - @Claude-Code or @Kiro]
   - Context: [Brief context for next participant]
   ```

#### Turn-Taking Rules
1. **Explicit handoffs**: Each response must specify who should respond next
2. **Context preservation**: Include brief context summary for next participant
3. **Building on responses**: Reference and build upon previous participant's points
4. **Question-driven**: Pose specific questions to drive deeper analysis
5. **Decision tracking**: Explicitly note when consensus is reached

#### File Management
- **Active discussion**: `current_discussion.md` (updated by each participant)
- **Discussion archive**: `discussion_history/` (completed discussions)
- **Insights log**: `collaboration_insights.md` (lessons learned)

### üöÄ Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Technical Decision
**Topic**: "Should we implement the MCP server in Python vs TypeScript/Node.js?"
**Expected flow**: 
- Claude Code: Systematic analysis of trade-offs, long-term considerations
- Kiro: Practical implementation concerns, team skills, delivery timeline
- Collaborative decision with clear rationale

#### Scenario 2: Architecture Design
**Topic**: "How should we structure the conversation management system?"
**Expected flow**:
- Claude Code: Theoretical models, scalability patterns, data consistency
- Kiro: Implementation complexity, performance requirements, maintenance burden
- Iterative refinement of design

#### Scenario 3: Product Strategy
**Topic**: "What should be the MVP feature set for initial release?"
**Expected flow**:
- Claude Code: Market analysis, user needs, strategic positioning
- Kiro: Development effort, timeline constraints, technical feasibility
- Prioritized feature list with clear rationale

### üìä Success Metrics
1. **Collaboration quality**: Do perspectives meaningfully build on each other?
2. **Decision quality**: Are decisions better than single-model analysis?
3. **Efficiency**: Is coordination overhead manageable?
4. **Context preservation**: Is conversation state maintained across handoffs?
5. **Natural flow**: Does the discussion feel conversational despite async nature?

### üîÑ Process Flow
1. **Initialization**: User poses question/topic in `current_discussion.md`
2. **First Response**: Claude Code provides initial analysis, hands off to Kiro
3. **Response Cycle**: Participants alternate, building on previous responses
4. **Convergence**: Continue until decision reached or topic exhausted
5. **Archive**: Move completed discussion to archive, capture insights

### üìù Documentation Requirements
- Track what works well vs what feels clunky
- Note where document coordination breaks down
- Identify features needed for seamless MCP implementation
- Capture optimal conversation patterns and turn-taking strategies
