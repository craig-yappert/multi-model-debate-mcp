# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Multi-Model Debate MCP Server enables multiple AI models from different providers to engage in real-time collaborative discussions with users through the Model Context Protocol. This system eliminates the copy/paste friction of current multi-model workflows by creating a genuine collaborative environment where different AI models with distinct personas participate simultaneously in structured debates.

**Prototype Phase**: Before building the full MCP server, we will test the collaboration concept using document-based coordination between Claude Code (Opus 4.1) as Research Lead and Kiro (Sonnet 4.0) as Execution Reality Check to validate the approach and identify optimal conversation patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: MCP Server Foundation

**User Story:** As a developer using Claude Code, I want to connect to a multi-model debate server through MCP, so that I can access collaborative AI discussions without leaving my development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user configures the MCP server in their client THEN the server SHALL establish a connection using the MCP protocol
2. WHEN the MCP server starts THEN it SHALL register all required tools for debate management
3. WHEN a client connects THEN the server SHALL be discoverable and respond to MCP handshake requests
4. IF the server configuration is invalid THEN the server SHALL provide clear error messages and fail gracefully

### Requirement 2: Multi-Model Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to have multiple AI models (Claude Opus, Claude Sonnet, GPT-4, Gemini) participate in the same conversation, so that I can get diverse perspectives on complex problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a debate is started THEN the system SHALL support at least 2 different Claude models simultaneously
2. WHEN OpenAI integration is implemented THEN the system SHALL support mixing Anthropic and OpenAI models in the same debate
3. WHEN a model provider API fails THEN the system SHALL continue the debate with remaining functional models
4. WHEN adding a new model provider THEN the system SHALL use a consistent interface without breaking existing functionality
5. IF a model's API key is invalid THEN the system SHALL report the specific model that failed and continue with others

### Requirement 3: Persona-Based Debate Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want each AI model to have a distinct persona and role in the debate, so that I get meaningfully different perspectives rather than similar responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a debate starts THEN each participant SHALL have a clearly defined persona (Research Lead, Engineering, Product Strategy, Execution)
2. WHEN a model responds THEN it SHALL consistently maintain its assigned persona throughout the conversation
3. WHEN configuring participants THEN users SHALL be able to assign custom personas to any model
4. WHEN a persona is undefined THEN the system SHALL use a default persona appropriate for the model type
5. IF persona configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL use fallback personas and log the issue

### Requirement 4: Conversation Context Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want all models to have access to the full conversation history, so that they can build on each other's points and maintain coherent discussions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message THEN all active models SHALL receive the complete conversation context
2. WHEN a model responds THEN its response SHALL be added to the context for subsequent model responses
3. WHEN conversation history exceeds context limits THEN the system SHALL intelligently truncate while preserving key discussion points
4. WHEN a debate session ends THEN the conversation history SHALL be persisted for future reference
5. IF context management fails THEN the system SHALL provide at least the current message to models

### Requirement 5: Real-Time Debate Orchestration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to participate in a flowing conversation with multiple AI models, so that the discussion feels natural rather than like separate individual consultations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message THEN all active models SHALL respond in a coordinated manner
2. WHEN models generate responses THEN they SHALL be presented in a clear, organized format showing each participant
3. WHEN a model takes too long to respond THEN the system SHALL continue with other models and note the delay
4. WHEN all models have responded THEN the user SHALL be able to immediately continue the conversation
5. IF a model fails to respond THEN the debate SHALL continue with remaining participants

### Requirement 6: Debate Session Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to start, manage, and configure debate sessions, so that I can control which models participate and how the discussion is structured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a new debate THEN the user SHALL be able to specify a topic and select participants
2. WHEN a debate is active THEN the user SHALL be able to add or remove participants mid-conversation
3. WHEN querying debate status THEN the system SHALL provide current participants, topic, and conversation length
4. WHEN ending a debate THEN the system SHALL properly clean up resources and save conversation history
5. IF no participants are configured THEN the system SHALL use a default set of 4 personas

### Requirement 7: Configuration and Extensibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily configure API keys, model settings, and personas, so that I can customize the debate system for my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN API keys SHALL be loaded from environment variables or configuration files
2. WHEN adding a new model THEN it SHALL require only configuration changes, not code modifications
3. WHEN defining custom personas THEN they SHALL be configurable through YAML configuration
4. WHEN model settings change THEN the system SHALL reload configuration without requiring restart
5. IF configuration is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and suggested fixes

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the debate system to handle errors gracefully, so that temporary issues with one model don't break the entire conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model API returns an error THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with other models
2. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL retry requests with exponential backoff
3. WHEN rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL queue requests and inform the user of delays
4. WHEN the system encounters unexpected errors THEN it SHALL provide helpful error messages to the user
5. IF all models fail THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest troubleshooting steps

### Requirement 9: Document-Based Prototype Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test the multi-model collaboration concept using document coordination before building the full MCP server, so that I can validate the approach and optimize conversation patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing collaboration THEN Claude Code SHALL act as Research Lead with deep analytical perspective
2. WHEN testing collaboration THEN Kiro SHALL act as Execution Reality Check with practical implementation focus
3. WHEN participants respond THEN they SHALL use structured format with explicit handoffs and context preservation
4. WHEN discussions conclude THEN insights SHALL be captured about what works well and what needs improvement
5. IF document coordination breaks down THEN specific issues SHALL be documented for MCP server design
