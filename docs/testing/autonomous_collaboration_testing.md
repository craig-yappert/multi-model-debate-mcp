# Autonomous Collaboration Testing Strategy

## Research Questions to Validate

### Primary Research Goals
1. **Does autonomous collaboration improve decision quality?**
2. **What's the optimal exchange limit for productive discussions?**
3. **Do personas maintain distinctiveness during autonomous exchanges?**
4. **When do discussions become circular or unproductive?**
5. **How effectively do termination conditions work?**

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Technical Decision Making
**Setup:** Present technical choice requiring both research depth and practical constraints
**Example:** "Should we use FastAPI or Flask for the MCP server?"
**Expected Flow:**
- Claude-Research: Systematic analysis of frameworks
- Kiro: Practical implementation concerns
- 3-4 exchanges refining the decision
- Clear recommendation with rationale

**Success Metrics:**
- Decision reached within 6 exchanges
- Both perspectives represented
- Clear rationale provided
- No circular arguments

### Scenario 2: Problem Solving
**Setup:** Present complex problem needing iterative analysis
**Example:** "How should we handle context overflow in long conversations?"
**Expected Flow:**
- Initial problem decomposition
- Multiple solution proposals
- Iterative refinement based on constraints
- Converged solution

**Success Metrics:**
- Solution quality improves through iterations
- Multiple approaches considered
- Practical constraints addressed
- Implementation plan emerges

### Scenario 3: Design Discussion
**Setup:** Architecture decision requiring strategic and execution input
**Example:** "How should we structure the MCP tool hierarchy?"
**Expected Flow:**
- Research: Long-term maintainability analysis
- Execution: Implementation complexity assessment
- Back-and-forth refinement
- Balanced design decision

**Success Metrics:**
- Design balances strategic and practical concerns
- Trade-offs explicitly discussed
- Decision rationale is clear
- Implementation path identified

## Termination Condition Testing

### Test 1: Consensus Achievement
**Trigger:** Both participants agree on approach
**Expected:** Discussion ends with summary
**Validation:** Check for clear agreement signals

### Test 2: Clear Disagreement
**Trigger:** Fundamental disagreement after 3+ exchanges
**Expected:** Flag for user decision
**Validation:** Disagreement clearly articulated

### Test 3: Exchange Limit
**Trigger:** 6 exchanges without resolution
**Expected:** Summary of discussion state
**Validation:** No attempt to continue beyond limit

### Test 4: Circular Discussion
**Trigger:** Repeated arguments without progress
**Expected:** Early termination with status
**Validation:** Detection of repetitive patterns

## User Intervention Testing

### Test 1: Mid-Discussion Intervention
**Setup:** User posts message during exchange 3
**Expected:** Immediate pause, acknowledge user input
**Validation:** No additional autonomous exchanges

### Test 2: Direct Question
**Setup:** User asks specific question during autonomous discussion
**Expected:** Direct answer, pause autonomous mode
**Validation:** Question answered before resuming

### Test 3: @Mention Usage
**Setup:** User @mentions specific participant
**Expected:** That participant responds, others pause
**Validation:** Only mentioned participant responds

## Persona Consistency Testing

### Research Lead Consistency
**Validate:**
- Maintains analytical depth throughout exchanges
- Asks probing questions
- References long-term implications
- Challenges assumptions systematically

### Execution Reality Check Consistency
**Validate:**
- Focuses on practical constraints
- Identifies implementation blockers
- Pushes for actionable solutions
- Flags theoretical drift

## Quality Metrics

### Discussion Quality Indicators
- **Perspective Diversity:** Both personas contribute unique viewpoints
- **Progressive Refinement:** Ideas improve through iterations
- **Constructive Challenge:** Ideas are tested and strengthened
- **Clear Resolution:** Discussions end with actionable outcomes

### Efficiency Metrics
- **Exchange Count:** Average exchanges needed for resolution
- **Time to Resolution:** Total discussion duration
- **User Intervention Rate:** How often user needs to intervene
- **Circular Discussion Rate:** Percentage of unproductive discussions

### User Experience Metrics
- **Transparency:** User understands discussion progress
- **Control:** User can intervene effectively when needed
- **Value:** Autonomous discussions produce better outcomes than single responses

## Test Data Collection

### Automated Logging
```yaml
discussion_log:
  session_id: "uuid"
  start_time: "timestamp"
  participants: ["claude-research", "kiro"]
  trigger_topic: "string"
  exchanges:
    - participant: "claude-research"
      message: "string"
      timestamp: "timestamp"
      exchange_number: 1
  termination_reason: "consensus|disagreement|limit|circular|user_intervention"
  final_summary: "string"
  user_interventions: []
  quality_metrics:
    perspective_diversity: 0.8
    progressive_refinement: 0.9
    resolution_clarity: 0.7
```

### Manual Evaluation Criteria
- **Decision Quality:** Is the final decision better than individual responses?
- **Process Efficiency:** Was the discussion productive or wasteful?
- **Persona Authenticity:** Did participants maintain their roles?
- **User Experience:** Was the autonomous discussion helpful or distracting?

## Success Criteria

### MVP Success Thresholds
- **80% of discussions** reach productive conclusion within 6 exchanges
- **90% persona consistency** maintained throughout discussions
- **<10% circular discussions** requiring early termination
- **User intervention works** 100% of the time when attempted
- **Decision quality improvement** measurable vs single responses

### Failure Conditions Requiring Rule Updates
- **>30% circular discussions** - Reduce exchange limit or improve termination detection
- **Persona drift >20%** - Strengthen persona enforcement rules
- **User intervention failures** - Fix pause/resume logic
- **Low decision quality** - Revise collaboration guidelines

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Validation (1-2 days)
- Test 3 core scenarios with manual evaluation
- Validate termination conditions work
- Confirm user intervention mechanisms

### Phase 2: Extended Testing (3-5 days)
- Run 20+ test discussions across different topics
- Collect automated metrics
- Identify common failure patterns

### Phase 3: Rule Refinement (1-2 days)
- Adjust exchange limits based on data
- Refine termination condition logic
- Update persona consistency rules

### Phase 4: Production Validation (Ongoing)
- Monitor real usage patterns
- Collect user feedback
- Iterate on rules based on actual usage
