# VS Code AI Collaboration Extension Proposal

**Bringing Multi-Model Debate into the Developer IDE**

---

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines the development of a VS Code extension that brings our proven multi-model AI debate system directly into the developer's IDE. By leveraging VS Code's Chat API and our existing MCP server architecture, we can create **context-aware AI collaboration** that understands what developers are actually working on.

**Key Value Proposition**: Instead of debating in isolation (Mattermost), AI personas collaborate with developers on the actual code, with full awareness of file content, debugging sessions, errors, and development context.

---

## Current State Analysis

### What We Have Built
- ✅ **Robust MCP Server**: Proven architecture with 5 working MCP tools
- ✅ **Sophisticated Personas**: `claude-research` (analytical) and `kiro` (practical execution)
- ✅ **Advanced Coordination Rules**: 2.0 YAML configuration with restraint guidelines
- ✅ **Context Management**: Conversation history and autonomous collaboration limits
- ✅ **Claude API Integration**: Working AI response generation with persona-specific prompts

### Current Limitations
- ❌ **Context Gap**: AI debates happen outside the codebase being discussed
- ❌ **Manual Context Transfer**: Developers must explain code context manually
- ❌ **Platform Switching**: Alt-tab between VS Code and Mattermost disrupts flow
- ❌ **Limited Code Awareness**: AI cannot see actual files, errors, or debugging state

## Proposed Solution: VS Code Extension Architecture

### Core Concept
Transform our existing MCP server into a **VS Code-native AI collaboration system** where personas participate in development discussions with full code context awareness.

### Example Workflow
```
Developer: "Should we refactor this auth function?" 
          (while viewing auth.js lines 45-60)

@claude-research: "Looking at lines 45-60, this function has 4 responsibilities 
                  and cyclomatic complexity of 8. The password hashing logic is 
                  mixed with validation. Consider extracting..."

@kiro: "Function works fine for our 10K users. I see 3 TODO comments and error 
       handling that swallows exceptions. Let's fix the error handling first 
       before refactoring - less risk, immediate value."
```

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Extension Foundation
```typescript
// VS Code Extension Structure
src/
├── extension.ts              // Main extension entry point
├── chat/
│   ├── participants.ts       // Chat participant registration
│   ├── context-analyzer.ts   // VS Code context gathering
│   └── response-handler.ts   // AI response processing
├── mcp/
│   ├── client.ts            // MCP client connection
│   └── adapter.ts           // Adapt existing MCP server
└── storage/
    ├── conversation-store.ts // Workspace-based persistence
    └── context-history.ts   // Project decision history
```

### 2. Reuse Existing MCP Server
**Keep 90% of current architecture:**
```typescript
// Existing MCP server becomes the AI brain
class VSCodeMCPClient {
  private mcpConnection: MCPConnection;
  
  constructor() {
    // Connect to existing mcp_server.py
    this.mcpConnection = new MCPConnection('./src/mcp_server.py');
  }
  
  async contribute(message: string, persona: string, codeContext: VSCodeContext) {
    // Enhance existing contribute tool with VS Code context
    return await this.mcpConnection.callTool('contribute', {
      message,
      persona,
      context: {
        ...codeContext,  // Rich VS Code context
        workspace: vscode.workspace.name,
        activeFile: vscode.window.activeTextEditor?.document.fileName
      }
    });
  }
}
```

### 3. Rich Context Integration
**What AI personas would have access to:**
```typescript
interface VSCodeContext {
  // Current work context
  activeFile: {
    path: string;
    content: string;
    selectedText?: string;
    cursorPosition: number;
  };
  
  // Project state
  workspace: {
    name: string;
    files: string[];
    gitBranch: string;
    recentChanges: GitDiff[];
  };
  
  // Development context
  debugging: {
    isActive: boolean;
    breakpoints: vscode.Breakpoint[];
    variables?: vscode.Variable[];
  };
  
  // Error context
  diagnostics: vscode.Diagnostic[];
  terminalOutput: string[];
  
  // Team context (from our existing system)
  conversationHistory: ConversationMessage[];
  currentTopic: string;
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
**Goal**: Working VS Code extension with basic chat participants

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ VS Code extension scaffold with Chat API integration
- ✅ `@claude-research` and `@kiro` chat participants registered
- ✅ Connection to existing MCP server
- ✅ Basic context gathering (active file, selected text)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```
User types: "@claude-research what do you think about this function?"
Extension: Calls existing MCP server with file context
AI: Responds with analysis of actual function code
```

### Phase 2: Rich Context Integration (Week 3)
**Goal**: AI personas understand full development context

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ Comprehensive context gathering (debugging, errors, git state)
- ✅ Integration with VS Code workspace APIs
- ✅ Enhanced prompt engineering with code context
- ✅ Real-time error and diagnostic awareness

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```
User: "@kiro this test is failing"
kiro: "I see the test failure in terminal. Line 23 expects 'success' but got 
      'undefined'. The issue is in auth.js:67 where you're not returning the 
      response. Also, your mock in test setup isn't matching the actual API."
```

### Phase 3: Conversation Persistence (Week 4)
**Goal**: Project-scoped conversation history and decision tracking

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ Workspace-based conversation storage
- ✅ Project decision history
- ✅ Context bridging between sessions
- ✅ Export/import conversation history

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Conversations persist across VS Code sessions
- AI personas remember previous decisions and context
- Teams can review AI collaboration history
- Conversations are scoped to specific workspaces/projects

### Phase 4: Advanced Collaboration (Week 5-6)
**Goal**: Sophisticated AI-AI coordination within development context

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ Autonomous collaboration with code awareness
- ✅ Task delegation between personas
- ✅ Context-aware suggestion application
- ✅ Integration with VS Code's edit/refactor capabilities

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```
claude-research: "This function needs refactoring - high complexity."
kiro: "I can extract the validation logic. Here's the refactor:"
      [Provides specific code diff]
User: [Accepts suggestion]
Extension: Applies refactor using VS Code edit APIs
```

## Conclusion

This proposal leverages our proven multi-model debate architecture while solving the critical context gap that limits current AI collaboration. By bringing AI personas directly into VS Code with full code awareness, we create a **natural evolution** of our collaborative AI system.

**The key insight**: Instead of debating about code in external systems, AI personas collaborate with developers on the actual code with complete context awareness.

**Implementation risk is low** because we reuse 90% of existing architecture while adding the context awareness that makes AI collaboration truly valuable for developers.
