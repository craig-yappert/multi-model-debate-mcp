# Multi-Agent Chat Interface: Personal Exploration Project

## Overview

This document outlines a personal research project to build a custom multi-agent chat interface for VS Code. The goal is to explore better patterns for AI-to-AI communication and overcome current limitations with file access and tool availability when working with multiple AI agents.

## Current Pain Points

### Agent Communication Challenges
- **Limited Agent-to-Agent Autonomy**: Current systems lack sophisticated mechanisms for agents to communicate independently, requiring constant human mediation
- **No Order Control**: Difficult to manage conversation flow between multiple agents or establish clear response patterns
- **Context Loss**: Agents operate in silos without shared understanding of the broader task

### Technical Friction
- **File Access Restrictions**: Constantly having to manually share files via `#file` references or copy-paste content
- **Tool Limitations**: Different agents have different tool access, creating asymmetric capabilities
- **Platform Dependencies**: Tied to specific chat interfaces (GitHub Copilot, browser-based Claude, etc.) with their own constraints

## Proposed Solution: Custom Webview Architecture

### Core Concept

Build a VS Code extension with a custom webview that acts as a unified interface for multiple AI agents, with Claude Code potentially serving as an execution layer.

### Key Components

#### 1. Unified Chat Interface
- Custom webview within VS Code for all agent interactions
- Direct workspace access without manual file sharing
- Real-time file monitoring and context awareness

#### 2. Agent Coordination Layer
```typescript
// Example coordination pattern
interface AgentCapabilities {
  canExecute: boolean;  // e.g., Claude Code
  canAnalyze: boolean;  // e.g., GPT-4
  canDesign: boolean;   // e.g., Claude Opus
}

// Agent handoff and response ordering
class AgentCoordinator {
  async delegateTask(task: Task): Promise<Response> {
    const bestAgent = this.selectAgentByCapability(task);
    return await bestAgent.process(task);
  }
}
```

#### 3. Shared Context Service
- Maintains codebase state across all agents
- Tracks conversation history and decisions
- Provides consistent view of project structure

## Technical Exploration Areas

### Immediate Focus
1. **Basic Webview**: Simple chat interface with file system access
2. **MCP Integration**: Connect to existing MCP servers for agent communication
3. **File Context**: Automatic file reading/monitoring without manual sharing

### Future Exploration
1. **Agent Orchestration**: Experiment with different coordination patterns
2. **Tool Unification**: Standardize tool access across agents
3. **Execution Delegation**: Claude Code as primary execution layer

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (2-3 weeks)
- Basic webview with chat interface
- Single AI provider integration (Claude API)
- Direct file system access demonstration
- Simple message routing between agents

### Phase 2: Multi-Agent Foundation (3-4 weeks)
- Add second AI provider (OpenAI/local model)
- Basic agent coordination logic
- Shared context implementation
- MCP server integration for existing agents

### Phase 3: Advanced Coordination (4-6 weeks)
- Agent capability registry
- Task delegation patterns
- Order control mechanisms
- Response aggregation strategies

### Phase 4: Refinement (Ongoing)
- UI/UX improvements based on usage
- Performance optimizations
- Additional agent integrations
- Workflow automation experiments

## Technical Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Extension**: TypeScript with VS Code Extension API
- **UI**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript webview
- **Communication**: WebSocket for real-time agent updates
- **Storage**: Local workspace storage for context
- **AI Integration**: Direct API calls to various providers

### Key VS Code APIs
```typescript
// Unrestricted file access
vscode.workspace.fs.readFile(uri)
vscode.workspace.findFiles('**/*')

// File watching
vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher('**/*')

// Webview communication
webview.postMessage({ command: 'agentResponse', data })
```

## Personal Learning Goals

1. **Architecture Patterns**: Explore different approaches to multi-agent coordination
2. **Context Management**: Understand optimal ways to share state between agents
3. **Tool Integration**: Learn how to unify disparate tool access patterns
4. **User Experience**: Discover what makes agent collaboration feel natural

## Practical Benefits

### Immediate Improvements
- No more copy-pasting file contents between chat windows
- Unified conversation history across all agents
- Direct file manipulation without friction

### Exploration Opportunities
- Test different agent coordination strategies
- Experiment with autonomous agent workflows
- Build custom tools specific to personal workflows
- Learn VS Code extension development in depth

## Development Effort Assessment

### Realistic Time Investment
- **Week 1-2**: Basic webview and file access working
- **Week 3-4**: First multi-agent conversation possible
- **Week 5-8**: Refined coordination and MCP integration
- **Ongoing**: Incremental improvements based on daily usage

### Complexity Points
- **Webview Development**: Medium - Well-documented VS Code patterns exist
- **Agent Coordination**: High - Requires experimentation to find good patterns
- **File System Integration**: Low - VS Code APIs are straightforward
- **State Management**: Medium - Need to handle persistence and synchronization

## Recommended Starting Point

### Minimal Viable Prototype (MVP)
1. Create basic VS Code extension structure
2. Implement simple webview with chat UI
3. Add file reading capability (no manual sharing needed)
4. Connect to single AI API (Claude or GPT)
5. Test with simple coding tasks

### Success Criteria for MVP
- Can read any workspace file without explicit sharing
- Can maintain conversation context across sessions
- Can execute at least basic file operations
- Provides better experience than current copy-paste workflow

## Open Questions to Explore

1. **Execution Model**: Should Claude Code be the sole executor, or should other agents have limited execution capabilities?
2. **Conflict Resolution**: How to handle when agents disagree on approach?
3. **Context Limits**: How much shared context is too much?
4. **UI Design**: Single unified chat vs. split views for different agents?
5. **Persistence**: What conversation data should persist across sessions?

## Next Steps

1. **Technical Spike**: Build minimal webview with file access (1-2 days)
2. **Architecture Design**: Detail the agent communication protocol
3. **MVP Development**: Focus on single-agent with enhanced file access first
4. **Iteration**: Add multi-agent capabilities based on lessons learned
