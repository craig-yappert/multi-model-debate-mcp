# Multi-Model Debate MCP Server - Status Update

## Current Status: OPERATIONAL (Demo Mode)

The MCP server is now working and can be used with Claude Code. The server runs in demo mode when API keys are not configured.

### Recent Fixes

1. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Server no longer crashes when API keys are missing
   - Graceful fallback to demo mode
   - Better startup messages

2. **Demo Mode Features**
   - Server works without Mattermost connection
   - Server works without Anthropic API key
   - Tools return demo responses for testing
   - Conversation history is maintained in memory

3. **Startup Behavior**
   - Clear status messages during initialization
   - Warnings instead of errors for missing services
   - Server continues running even without external services

### Server Modes

#### Full Mode (with API keys)
- Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in .env file
- Optional `CLAUDE_RESEARCH_BOT_TOKEN` for Mattermost
- Full AI-powered responses
- Real Mattermost integration

#### Demo Mode (without API keys)
- No external services required
- Tools return [DEMO MODE] prefixed responses
- Conversation history maintained locally
- Perfect for testing MCP integration

### How to Run

1. **For Claude Code Integration**:
   - The server is already configured in Claude Code
   - Tools should appear in Claude Code interface
   - Use the MCP tools to interact with the debate system

2. **For Testing**:
   ```bash
   python test_mcp_startup.py
   ```

3. **For Direct Execution**:
   ```bash
   python src/mcp_server.py
   ```

### Available Tools

1. **read_discussion** - Read recent team discussion
   - In demo mode: Returns local conversation history
   - In full mode: Fetches from Mattermost

2. **contribute** - Post a message as a persona
   - In demo mode: Adds to local history
   - In full mode: Posts to Mattermost and generates AI response

3. **get_conversation_context** - Get conversation summary
   - In demo mode: Returns local context summary
   - In full mode: Analyzes Mattermost discussion

### Configuration

- Config file: `config/chat_coordination_rules.yaml`
- Personas: claude-research, kiro
- Team: multi-model-debate
- Channel: general

### Next Steps

1. **To Enable Full Mode**:
   - Add your Anthropic API key to .env file
   - Add Mattermost bot token if using Mattermost
   - Restart the server

2. **To Use in Claude Code**:
   - Server should be detected automatically
   - Look for "multi-model-debate" tools in Claude Code
   - If not visible, restart Claude Code

3. **For Production Use**:
   - Configure real API keys
   - Set up Mattermost instance
   - Adjust retry and cache settings as needed

## Summary

The MCP server is operational and ready for use. It gracefully handles missing services and provides a demo mode for testing. The server can be used immediately in Claude Code without any API keys for basic testing.
