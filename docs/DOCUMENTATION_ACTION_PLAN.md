# 📋 Documentation Action Plan

**Created**: 2025-09-13  
**Purpose**: Systematic plan to improve documentation based on Kiro's analysis  
**Priority**: Complete before Kiro-IDE integration  

## 🎯 Overview

The documentation has been successfully reorganized and is mostly accurate, but several gaps and inconsistencies remain that could confuse new users. This plan addresses those issues systematically.

## ✅ Quick Wins (COMPLETED)

- [x] **Path Reference Cleanup**: Fixed old nested directory paths in setup files
- [x] **Enhanced .env.example**: Added missing variables and clear comments
- [x] **Mattermost Setup Path**: Updated to use relative paths

## 🚀 High Priority (Tomorrow - Before Kiro Integration)

2. **Afternoon**: Write API reference with current tool schemas
3. **Evening**: Document configuration system

### Phase 2: Polish and Examples (Day 2)
1. **Morning**: Create usage examples with real scenarios
2. **Afternoon**: Enhance setup guide with quick start
3. **Evening**: Archive or fix problematic files

### Phase 3: Advanced Topics (Week 2)
1. Production deployment guide
2. Developer documentation
3. Testing procedures

## 📝 Content Guidelines

### Writing Standards
- **Accuracy First**: Test every documented procedure
- **User-Focused**: Write for people trying to accomplish tasks
- **Example-Heavy**: Show, don't just tell
- **Troubleshooting-Aware**: Anticipate common problems
