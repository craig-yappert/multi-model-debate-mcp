# üì¶ Archive Index

This folder contains outdated, superseded, or historical documentation that has been replaced by current documentation.

## üóÇÔ∏è Archive Structure

### `/original-docs/`
Original documentation that described the vision but not the implementation.

- **`old-README.md`** - Original README describing multi-provider AI debates
  - **Replaced by**: `../current/README.md`
  - **Why archived**: Described unimplemented features as if they were working

### `/old-specs/`
Technical specifications for features that were planned but not implemented.

- **`multi_model_debate_spec.md`** - Complete technical specification for multi-model debates
  - **Replaced by**: `../roadmap/FUTURE_VISION.md`
  - **Why archived**: Specification for unbuilt features

- **`technical_requirements.md`** - Technical requirements document
  - **Replaced by**: `../current/TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md`
  - **Why archived**: Requirements not matching actual implementation

- **`multi_model_debate_spec-duplicate.md`** - Duplicate specification file
  - **Replaced by**: `../roadmap/FUTURE_VISION.md`
  - **Why archived**: Duplicate content of same unimplemented features

- **`requirements.md`** - Formal requirements document with user stories
  - **Replaced by**: `../current/README.md` (for working features)
  - **Why archived**: Requirements for unimplemented multi-provider system

### `/historical/`
Previous status documents and project structure files.

- **`old-STATUS.md`** - Previous status document with demo mode references
  - **Replaced by**: `../current/STATUS.md`
  - **Why archived**: Referenced removed demo mode, outdated server state

- **`PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`** - Old project structure documentation
  - **Replaced by**: `../current/TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md`
  - **Why archived**: Structure didn't match actual codebase

- **`KIRO_HANDOFF.md`** - Historical handoff document
  - **Replaced by**: `../current/STATUS.md`
  - **Why archived**: Historical context, current status is more accurate

## üîÑ What Was Changed

### Major Documentation Issues Fixed

1. **Reality vs Vision Confusion**
   - **Problem**: README described multi-provider AI system that wasn't built
   - **Solution**: Separate current reality from future vision

2. **Outdated Status Information**
   - **Problem**: STATUS.md referenced removed demo mode and wrong server state
   - **Solution**: Current status based on actual validation of working tools

3. **Inaccurate Technical Details**
   - **Problem**: Architecture diagrams and specs for unimplemented features
   - **Solution**: Technical reference matching actual server implementation

4. **Scattered Setup Information**
   - **Problem**: Setup instructions spread across multiple files
   - **Solution**: Consolidated setup guide with actual working steps

### Key Improvements

- ‚úÖ **Accuracy**: All `current/` documentation reflects working implementation
- ‚úÖ **Clarity**: Clear separation between current capabilities and future plans
- ‚úÖ **Completeness**: Comprehensive setup guide with troubleshooting
- ‚úÖ **Organization**: Logical structure with clear navigation
- ‚úÖ **Validation**: All documented features tested and confirmed working

## üö´ Do Not Use These Files

The archived documentation contains:
- **Incorrect feature descriptions** (multi-provider AI that doesn't exist)
- **Outdated setup instructions** (demo mode that was removed)
- **Wrong architecture details** (components that weren't built)
- **Invalid configuration examples** (settings that don't work)

## üìö Migration Reference

| Archived File | Current Replacement | Key Changes |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| `old-README.md` | `../current/README.md` | Reality-based feature list, working examples |
| `multi_model_debate_spec.md` | `../roadmap/FUTURE_VISION.md` | Moved unimplemented specs to future roadmap |
| `old-STATUS.md` | `../current/STATUS.md` | Actual server validation, removed demo mode |
| `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` | `../current/TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md` | Real implementation details |

## üïê Historical Context

**Original Documentation Created**: ~2024 (estimated)
**Implementation Reality Gap**: Vision described advanced multi-model AI system, implementation was Mattermost + Claude only
**Documentation Reorganization**: 2025-09-13
**Validation Performed**: All MCP tools tested and confirmed working

### Why The Gap Occurred

The original documentation was written as a specification/vision document rather than user documentation. It described what the system should become, not what it actually was. This is common in early-stage projects but becomes problematic when users try to use the system based on the documentation.

### Lessons Learned

1. **Document reality first, vision second**
2. **Separate current features from roadmap items**
3. **Test all documented features before publishing**
4. **Update docs immediately when implementation changes**
