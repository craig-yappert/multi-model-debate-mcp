## üöÄ What This Is

Instead of this painful workflow:
```
You: *writes idea in Claude Code*
Claude Opus: *responds with deep analysis*
You: *copy/pastes to document*
You: *opens new Claude session with Sonnet*
Claude Sonnet: *different perspective on same idea*  
You: *more copy/pasting between documents*
```

Get this seamless collaboration:
```
You: "Should we rebuild our authentication system using OAuth 2.0?"

Research Lead (Claude Opus): "From a strategic perspective, OAuth 2.0 
addresses enterprise requirements, but we need systematic analysis of 
migration complexity and user impact..."

Engineering (GPT-4): "Implementation-wise, this adds significant 
complexity. Current JWT system works fine - what specific problems 
are we solving? Also consider vendor lock-in risks..."

Product Strategy (Gemini): "Enterprise prospects consistently request 
SSO during sales calls. 67% of deals stall without it. The business 
case is strong if we're targeting B2B expansion..."

Execution (Claude Sonnet): "Let's be practical - current system handles 
50K users reliably. If this is for enterprise sales, focus on Azure AD + 
Google Workspace for 80% coverage..."

You: "It's actually blocking $500K ARR in enterprise deals. Sales needs this by Q2."

Research Lead: "That changes everything - $500K ARR justifies significant investment..."
*[debate continues naturally]*
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- API keys for model providers:
  - [Anthropic API Key](https://console.anthropic.com/) (for Claude models)
  - [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) (for GPT models) 
  - [Google AI API Key](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) (for Gemini models)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-model-debate-mcp
cd multi-model-debate-mcp

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure API keys
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml with your API keys
```

### Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` with your API keys:

```yaml
models:
  claude-opus-4-1:
    provider: "anthropic"
    api_key: "your-anthropic-api-key-here"
    
  gpt-4o:
    provider: "openai"
    api_key: "your-openai-api-key-here"
    
  gemini-ultra:
    provider: "google"
    api_key: "your-google-api-key-here"
```

### Connect to Claude Code

Add to your Claude Code MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "multi-model-debate": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "multi_model_debate.server"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/multi-model-debate-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Start Your First Debate

```bash
# Run the server
python -m multi_model_debate.server

# In Claude Code, you'll now see multi-model debate tools available
# Start a debate on any topic and watch the magic happen!
```

## üí° Usage Examples

### Technical Architecture Decision
```
You: "Should we use GraphQL or REST for our new API?"

Research Lead: "This requires systematic analysis of our specific use case. GraphQL offers query flexibility and reduces over-fetching, but adds complexity..."

Engineering: "GraphQL has a steeper learning curve and debugging complexity. REST is proven at scale. What problems are we actually solving?"

Execution: "Our mobile team is already comfortable with REST. GraphQL would require training and new tooling. Is the benefit worth the cost?"
```

### Product Feature Discussion  
```
You: "Should we build native mobile apps or stick with our web app?"

Product Strategy: "User research shows 73% of power users request native apps. App store presence could significantly increase discovery..."

Engineering: "Native development means maintaining iOS + Android codebases. Consider React Native or Flutter for code reuse..."

Execution: "Current team has zero mobile experience. Either we hire mobile devs or plan 6+ month ramp-up time..."
```

## üìä Why This Matters

### The Problem
Current AI workflows are fragmented:
- ‚ùå Copy/paste between different AI tools
- ‚ùå Lost context when switching models  
- ‚ùå No collaboration between AI perspectives
- ‚ùå Sequential handoffs instead of real discussion
- ‚ùå User as middleman, not participant

### The Solution  
True collaborative AI intelligence:
- ‚úÖ Real-time multi-model conversations
- ‚úÖ Preserved context across all participants
- ‚úÖ Different AI architectures contributing unique perspectives  
- ‚úÖ Human as equal participant in the discussion
- ‚úÖ Seamless integration with existing tools

### The Impact
- **Better decisions**: Multi-perspective analysis reveals blind spots
- **Faster iteration**: No context switching or manual coordination
- **Enhanced creativity**: Models spark ideas off each other
- **Reduced cognitive load**: AI handles perspective management
- **Scalable wisdom**: Easily add new viewpoints and expertise
