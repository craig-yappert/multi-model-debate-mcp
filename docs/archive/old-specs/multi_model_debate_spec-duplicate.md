# Multi-Model Debate MCP Server
## Project Specification & Technical Architecture

### 🎯 Project Vision

Create the world's first **Model-Agnostic Collaborative AI Council** using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This system enables multiple AI models from different providers to engage in real-time collaborative discussions with users, eliminating the copy/paste friction of current multi-model workflows.

### 🚀 Core Innovation

Instead of sequential AI handoffs or single-model interactions, this creates a **genuine collaborative environment** where:
- Multiple AI models with different architectures and perspectives participate simultaneously
- Each model brings unique strengths (Claude's reasoning, GPT's creativity, Gemini's multi-modal capabilities)
- Discussions are serialized but conversational, like a real meeting
- Users participate as equal voices, guiding discussions and making final decisions
- All models have access to the full conversation context

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### MCP Server Structure
```python
# Core server class
class MultiModelDebateServer(MCP.Server):
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = ModelRegistry()
        self.conversation = ConversationManager()
        self.orchestrator = DebateOrchestrator()
        
    # MCP Tools exposed to clients
    @mcp.tool("start_debate")
    async def start_debate(self, topic: str) -> str:
        """Initialize a new debate topic"""
        
    @mcp.tool("continue_discussion")  
    async def continue_discussion(self, message: str) -> str:
        """Add user input and get model responses"""
        
    @mcp.tool("get_context")
    async def get_context(self) -> str:
        """Retrieve current conversation state"""
        
    @mcp.tool("set_participants") 
    async def set_participants(self, models: List[str]) -> str:
        """Configure which models participate"""
```

#### Model Client Architecture
```python
# Abstract base for all model providers
class ModelClient(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def chat(self, message: str, context: str, persona: str) -> str:
        pass

# Concrete implementations
class ClaudeClient(ModelClient):
    def __init__(self, model: str, api_key: str):
        self.model = model  # "opus-4-1" or "sonnet-4"
        
class OpenAIClient(ModelClient):
    def __init__(self, model: str, api_key: str):
        self.model = model  # "gpt-4o"
        
class GeminiClient(ModelClient):
    def __init__(self, model: str, api_key: str):
        self.model = model  # "gemini-ultra"
```

#### Conversation Flow
```python
class DebateOrchestrator:
    async def process_user_input(self, message: str) -> List[ModelResponse]:
        # 1. Add user message to context
        self.conversation.add_user_message(message)
        
        # 2. Determine which models should respond
        active_models = self.get_active_participants()
        
        # 3. Generate responses from each model
        responses = []
        for model_id in active_models:
            model = self.models.get(model_id)
            persona = self.get_persona(model_id)
            context = self.conversation.get_context_for_model(model_id)
            
            response = await model.chat(message, context, persona)
            responses.append(ModelResponse(model_id, response))
            
            # Add to context for subsequent models
            self.conversation.add_model_response(model_id, response)
            
        return responses
```

### 💬 Example Conversation Flow

```
User: "Should we rebuild our authentication system to support SSO?"

Research Lead (Claude Opus): "This is a complex architectural decision that requires systematic analysis. First, let's examine our current authentication pain points: user friction, security compliance, and maintenance overhead. SSO could address user experience issues, but we need to consider the implications for our existing user base of 10M+ accounts. What's driving this requirement - is it customer requests, security audits, or operational efficiency?"

Engineering (GPT-4o): "From an implementation standpoint, SSO adds significant complexity. We're looking at OAuth 2.0/OIDC integration, potentially SAML for enterprise clients, and a migration path for existing username/password users. Current system handles 50k concurrent users - SSO providers like Auth0 or Okta can scale, but there's vendor lock-in risk. I'd estimate 3-4 months development time plus extensive testing."

Product Strategy (Gemini): "User research shows 67% of enterprise prospects request SSO during sales calls - it's becoming table stakes for B2B sales. Consumer users show 23% drop-off during signup, and SSO could reduce that significantly. However, we need to consider the UX for mixed environments where some users have corporate SSO and others don't. The business case is strong if we're targeting enterprise expansion."

Execution (Claude Sonnet): "Let's be practical here - we have Q3 deadlines and the current auth system works. If this is purely nice-to-have, maybe we defer. But if it's blocking enterprise sales, that's different. Can we start with Google/Microsoft OAuth for consumers and add enterprise SSO later? That's a 6-week MVP vs. a 4-month project."

User: "It's actually blocking two major enterprise deals worth $500K ARR combined. Sales needs this by end of Q2."

Research Lead: "That changes the equation completely - $500K ARR justifies significant technical investment. We should prioritize the specific SSO providers these prospects require."

Engineering: "With that context, I'd recommend starting with Azure AD and Google Workspace - those cover 80% of enterprise use cases. We can build a hybrid approach where SSO users bypass our auth entirely."

Product Strategy: "Agreed - let's also survey our existing enterprise customers about their SSO requirements to build the right roadmap."

Execution: "OK, so Azure AD + Google Workspace for Q2, broader SSO support in Q3. I can live with that timeline if we descope the consumer OAuth integration for now."

User: "Perfect - Engineering, can you spike the Azure AD integration this week? Product, get me that customer survey by Friday."
