# Multi-Agent Chat Extension: Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Building an enhanced VS Code chat interface that enables true multi-agent collaboration by forking and extending the Claude Code Chat extension.

## Key Goals
1. **Solve immediate pain points**: No more copy-paste file sharing between agents
2. **Enable agent-to-agent communication**: Autonomous coordination with order control
3. **Unified execution layer**: Claude Code as primary executor via MCP
4. **Maintain current operations**: Keep existing multi-model-debate system running

## Development Strategy

### Parallel Development Approach
- **Current System**: Keep `multi-model-debate` MCP server running as-is
- **New Development**: Fork Claude Code Chat into separate repository
- **Integration Point**: New extension will connect to existing MCP servers

### Repository Structure
```

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Foundation Setup
**Goal**: Get Claude Code Chat running locally with our modifications

**Tasks**:
1. Fork `claude-code-chat` to new repository
2. Clone and run locally
3. Understand codebase architecture
4. Create feature branch for multi-agent work
5. Document code structure for team

**Deliverables**:
- Working local development environment
- Architecture documentation
- Basic UI modifications proof-of-concept

### Week 2-3: Multi-Agent Core
**Goal**: Add multiple agent support to the chat interface

**Key Features**:
```typescript
// Agent selection in UI
interface AgentConfig {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  provider: 'anthropic' | 'openai' | 'local';
  capabilities: string[];
  mcpServer?: string;  // Connect to existing MCP
}

// Message routing
interface MultiAgentMessage {
  fromAgent: string;
  toAgent?: string;
  content: string;
  context: FileContext[];
  handoffReason?: string;
}
```

**Tasks**:
1. Add agent selector dropdown to chat UI
2. Implement message routing between agents
3. Create shared context management
4. Connect to multiple AI providers simultaneously

**Deliverables**:
- Multi-agent chat working with 2+ agents
- Basic handoff mechanism
- Shared file context between agents

### Week 4-5: Coordination Layer
**Goal**: Implement intelligent agent coordination

**Features**:
- Capability-based task routing
- Automatic agent selection based on task type
- Order control for agent responses
- Conflict resolution mechanisms

**Implementation**:
```typescript
class AgentCoordinator {
  // Analyze task and select best agent
  async delegateTask(task: Task): Promise<Agent> {
    const capabilities = this.analyzeRequiredCapabilities(task);
    return this.selectBestAgent(capabilities);
  }

  // Handle autonomous agent-to-agent communication
  async enableAutonomousMode(conversation: Conversation) {
    while (!conversation.isComplete()) {
      const nextAgent = this.determineNextAgent(conversation);
      const response = await nextAgent.process(conversation);
      conversation.addResponse(response);
    }
  }
}
```

**Deliverables**:
- Autonomous agent workflows
- Task delegation system
- Response ordering mechanisms

### Week 6: Claude Code Integration
**Goal**: Integrate Claude Code as primary execution layer

**Features**:
- Route all code execution to Claude Code MCP
- Execution queue management
- Result aggregation from multiple agents
- Error handling and retry logic

**Integration Points**:
- Connect to existing `multi-model-debate` MCP server
- Use Claude Code for all file operations
- Aggregate analysis from other agents before execution

### Week 7-8: Polish & Testing
**Goal**: Refine based on real usage

**Tasks**:
1. UI/UX improvements based on team feedback
2. Performance optimizations
3. Error handling enhancements
4. Documentation and examples

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Webview Chat Interface**
   - Built on Claude Code Chat foundation
   - Enhanced with multi-agent UI elements
   - Real-time updates from all agents

2. **Agent Registry**
   - Manages available agents and their capabilities
   - Dynamic agent discovery
   - Health monitoring

3. **Context Manager**
   - Shared file context across agents
   - Conversation history tracking
   - State persistence

4. **MCP Integration**
   - Connects to existing MCP servers
   - Claude Code for execution
   - Other agents via MCP protocol

5. **Coordination Engine**
   - Task analysis and routing
   - Handoff management
   - Conflict resolution

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Framework**: VS Code Extension API
- **UI**: Webview with React/HTML
- **Communication**: MCP protocol, REST APIs
- **AI Providers**: Anthropic, OpenAI, local models

## Getting Started (Team Instructions)

### Prerequisites
1. VS Code installed
2. Node.js 18+ and npm
3. Git
4. API keys for AI providers

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Clone the forked repository (once created)
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/multi-agent-chat-extension
cd multi-agent-chat-extension
npm install

# Run in development mode
# Press F5 in VS Code or use Run & Debug panel
```

### Development Workflow
1. Keep `multi-model-debate` MCP server running normally
2. Develop new features in `multi-agent-chat-extension`
3. Test integration between new extension and existing MCP
4. Gradually migrate functionality as needed

## Key Decisions & Rationale

### Why Fork Claude Code Chat?
- **Proven foundation**: Webview, file access, MCP integration already working
- **Time savings**: 3-4 weeks saved on basic infrastructure
- **Active development**: Can pull updates from upstream

### Why Separate Repository?
- **Clean separation**: Current system remains stable
- **Parallel development**: No risk to existing workflows
- **Easy rollback**: Can always revert to current system

### Why This Architecture?
- **Incremental value**: Each phase delivers usable features
- **Learning by doing**: Discover patterns through usage
- **Flexibility**: Can pivot based on what works

## Success Metrics

## Open Questions for Team Discussion

1. **Agent Priority**: Which agents should we support first?
2. **UI Design**: Single chat with agent labels vs. split view?
3. **Autonomy Level**: How much autonomous operation do we want?
4. **Context Limits**: How do we handle large file contexts?
5. **Persistence**: What should persist between sessions?

## Next Immediate Actions
